This project is a custom version of an explosive radius calculator, inspired by the NUKEMAP and the Roblox game *Emergency Response: Liberty County* (ERLC). It calculates the effects of explosions and visualizes their impact on a map, but is an independent work created with modifications.

## Credits
- Inspired by Alex Wellerstein's *NUKEMAP*.
- *Emergency Response: Liberty County* (ERLC) from Roblox, which inspired the idea and layout of the project.
