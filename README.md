# ERLC Nukemap

This project is an interactive explosion simulator, inspired by Alex Wellerstein's [Nukemap](https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/), and adapted for use in the **ERLC** (Emergency Response: Liberty County) Roblox game. Users can simulate the effects of a nuclear explosion based on various yields, with descriptions of the different damage radii.
